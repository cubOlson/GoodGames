    The home page would display a Navbar at the top of the page containing button links to their games library, their discussions, the home page via the GG logo as well as profile dropdown containing links to their profile settings, a help page and a sign out button. 

    --The left navbar could show the game you're currently playing, a current event hosted by the website, a wishlist and the user's bookshelves. Alternatively we could display a list of categories.

    --The main content of the home page would be a grid of cards for each category and each card would have a picture of the top rated game for that category. Alternatively this area could display a grid of upcoming titles or featured weekly / monthly titles. 
    These titles would each have a select with the played, currently playing and want to play options. If the user selects the played option a stars div will appear allowing the user to rate the game.
