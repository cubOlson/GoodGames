## Welcome to the GoodGames Repo! 
***GoodGames*** is a clone of GoodReads that focuses on surfacing the most popular video games to play. Users add to the community by adding reviews for games they've played. Games with the most user feedback are ranked against their peers, with the top 20 games from each category displayed for all to see and enjoy. Developers can leverage feedback from the site to improve their games, patch bugs, and promote new soon to be released titles.
