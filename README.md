## Welcome to the GoodGames Repo!
***GoodGames*** is a clone of GoodReads that focuses on surfacing the most popular video games to play. Users add to the community by adding reviews for games they've played. Games with the most user feedback are ranked against their peers, with the top 20 games from each category displayed for all to see and enjoy. Developers can leverage feedback from the site to improve their games, patch bugs, and promote new soon to be released titles.

CARRY OVER NOTES FROM SKELETON PROJECT README

Use this project skeleton as a starting point for structuring your app. Things to note

1. Sequelize configuration has not yet been added -- you will need to set that up yourself
2. You may find yourself wanting to use javascript -- js files can be added in public/javascripts and should be appended to the Pug templates as needed
3. CSS files can go in public/stylesheets and also will need to be added to Pug templates
